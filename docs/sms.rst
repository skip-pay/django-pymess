SMS
===

SMS messages that are stored inside Django model class defined later, are sent via SMS backend. There are implemented several SMS backends, every backed uses different SMS service like twillio or AWS SNS. For sending SMS message you can use function ``pymess.backend.sms.send`` or ``pymwess.backend.sms.send_template``.

.. function:: pymess.backend.sms.send(recipient, content, related_objects=None, tag=None, send_immediately=False, **kwargs)

  Function has two required parameters ``recipient`` which is a phone number of the receiver and ``content``. Attribute ``content`` is a text message that will be sent inside the SMS body. If setting ``PYMESS_SMS_USE_ACCENT`` is set to ``False``, accent in the content will be replaced by appropriate ascii characters. Attribute ``related_objects`` should contain a list of objects that you want to connect with the sent message (with generic relation). ``tag`` is string mark which is stored with the sent SMS message . The last non required parameter ``**sms_kwargs`` is extra data that will be stored inside SMS message model in field ``extra_data``.

.. function:: pymess.backend.sms.send_template(recipient, slug, context_data, locale=None, related_objects=None, tag=None, send_immediately=False)

  The second function is used for sending prepared templates that are stored inside template model (class that extends ``pymess.models.sms.AbstractSMSTemplate``). The first parameter ``recipient`` is phone number of the receiver, ``slug`` is key of the template, ``context_data`` is a dictionary that contains context data for rendering SMS content from the template, ``related_objects`` should contains list of objects that you want to connect with the sent message and  ``tag`` is string mark which is stored with the sent SMS message.

Models
------


.. class:: pymess.models.sms.OutputSMSMessage

  The model contains data of already sent SMS messages.

  .. attribute:: created_at

    Django ``DateTimeField``, contains date and time of creation.

  .. attribute:: changed_at

    Django ``DateTimeField``, contains date and time the of last change.

  .. attribute:: sent_at

    Django ``DateTimeField``, contains date and time of sending the SMS message.

  .. attribute:: recipient

    ``CharField`` that contains phone number of the receiver.

  .. attribute:: sender

    ``CharField`` that contains phone number of the sender. Field can be empty if backend doesn't provide sender number.

  .. attribute:: content

    ``TextField``, contains content of the SMS message.

  .. attribute:: template_slug

    If SMS was sent from the template, this attribute contains key of the template.

  .. attribute:: template

    If SMS was sent from the template, this attribute contains foreign key of the template. The reason why there is ``template_slug`` and ``template`` fields is that a template instance can be removed and it is good to keep at least the key of the template.

  .. attribute:: state

    Field contains the current state of the message. Allowed states are:

      * DEBUG - SMS was not sent because system is in debug mode
      * DELIVERED - SMS was delivered to the receiver
      * ERROR - SMS was raised during sending of the SMS message
      * ERROR_RETRY - error was raised during sending of the message, message will be retried
      * ERROR_UPDATE - error was raised during updating state of the SMS message
      * SENDING - SMS was sent to the external service
      * SENT - SMS was sent to the receiver
      * UNKNOWN - SMS was sent to the external service but its state is unknown
      * WAITING - SMS was not sent to the external service

  .. attribute:: backend

    Field contains path to the SMS backend that was used for sending of the SMS message.

  .. attribute:: error

    If error was raised during sending of the SMS message this field contains text description of the error.

  .. attribute:: extra_data

    Extra data stored with ``JSONField``.

  .. attribute:: extra_sender_data

    Extra data related to the SMS backend stored with ``JSONField``. Every SMS backend can have different extra data.

  .. attribute:: tag

    String tag that you can define during sending SMS message.

  .. attribute:: number_of_send_attempts

    Number of sending attempts. Value is set only when batch sending is used.

  .. attribute:: retry_sending

    Defines if message should be resent if sending failed.

  .. attribute:: related_objects

    Returns DB manager of ``pymess.models.sms.OutputSMSRelatedObject`` model that are related to the concrete SMS message.


.. class:: pymess.models.sms.OutputSMSRelatedObject

  Model for storing related objects that you can connect with the SMS message.

  .. attribute:: created_at

    Django ``DateTimeField``, contains date and time of creation.

  .. attribute:: changed_at

    Django ``DateTimeField``, contains date and time the of last change.

  .. attribute:: output_sms_message

    Foreign key to the SMS message.

  .. attribute:: content_type

    Content type of the stored model (generic relation)

  .. attribute:: object_id

    Primary key of a related object stored in django ``TextField``.


.. class:: pymess.models.sms.AbstractSMSTemplate

  Abstract class of SMS template which you can use to define your own SMS template model. Your model that extends this class is set inside setting ``PYMESS_SMS_TEMPLATE_MODEL``::

      PYMESS_SMS_TEMPLATE_MODEL = 'your_application.YourSMSTemplateModel'

  .. attribute:: created_at

    Django ``DateTimeField``, contains date and time of creation.

  .. attribute:: changed_at

    Django ``DateTimeField``, contains date and time the of last change.

  .. attribute:: slug

    Key of the SMS template in the string format (Django slug).

  .. attribute:: body

    Body of the SMS message. Final SMS content is rendered with Django template system by default.

  .. attribute:: is_active

    Sets whether the template is active and should be sent or not.

  .. method:: get_body()

    Returns body of the model message. You can use it to update SMS body before rendering.

  .. method:: render_body(context_data)

    Renders template stored inside ``body`` field to the message content. Standard Django template system is used by default.

  .. method:: can_send(recipient, context_data)

    Returns by default the value of ``is_active``. If you need to restrict sending SMS template for some reasons, you can override this method.

  .. method:: send(recipient, context_data, related_objects=None, tag=None)

    Checks if message can be sent, renders message content and sends it via defined backend. Finally, the sent message is returned. If message cannot be sent, ``None`` is returned.


.. class:: pymess.models.sms.SMSTemplate

  Default template model class that only inherits from ``pymess.models.sms.AbstractSMSTemplate``


Backends
--------

Backend is a class that is used for sending messages. Every backend must provide API defined by ``pymess.backends.sms.SMSBackend`` class. SMS backend is configured via ``PYMESS_SMS_SENDER_BACKEND`` (ex. ``PYMESS_SMS_SENDER_BACKEND = 'pymess.backend.sms.sns.SNSSMSBackend'``). There are currently implemented following SMS backends:

.. class:: pymess.backend.sms.dummy.DummySMSBackend

  Backend that can be used for testing. SMS is not sent, but is automatically set to the ``DEBUG`` state.

.. class:: pymess.backend.sms.sns.SNSSMSBackend

  Backend that uses amazon SNS for sending messages (https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)

.. class:: pymess.backend.sms.twilio.TwilioSMSBackend

  Backend that uses twilio service for sending SMS messages (https://www.twilio.com/)

.. class:: pymess.backend.sms.ats_sms_operator.ATSSMSBackend

  Czech ATS SMS service is used for sending SMS messages. Service and backend supports checking if SMS was actually delivered. (https://www.atspraha.cz/)

  Configuration of attributes according to ATS operator documentation::

    PYMESS_ATS_SMS_CONFIG = {
        'URL': 'http://fik.atspraha.cz/gwfcgi/XMLServerWrapper.fcgi',  # If you use default URL param, this doesn't need to be set
        'UNIQ_PREFIX': 'unique-id-prefix',  # If you use SMS service for more applications you can define this prefix and it will be added to the message ID
        'USERNAME': 'username',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'UNIQ_PREFIX': '',
        'VALIDITY': 60,
        'TEXTID': None,
        'OPTID': '',
    }

.. class:: pymess.backend.sms.sms_operator.SMSOperatorBackend

  Czech SMS operator service is used for sending SMS messages. Service and backend supports checking if SMS was actually delivered. (https://www.sms-operator.cz/)

  Configuration of attributes according to SMS operator documentation::

    PYMESS_SMS_OPERATOR_CONFIG = {
        'URL': 'https://www.sms-operator.cz/webservices/webservice.aspx',  # If you use default URL param, this doesn't need to be set
        'UNIQ_PREFIX': 'unique-id-prefix',  # If you uses SMS service for more applications you can define this prefix and it will be added to the message ID
         'USERNAME': 'username',
         'PASSWORD': 'password',
    }


Custom backend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to write your own Pymess SMS backend, you must create class that inherits from ``pymess.backends.sms.SMSBackend``::

.. class pymess.backends.sms.SMSBackend

  .. method:: publish_message(message)

    This method should send SMS message (obtained from the input argument) and update its state. This method must be overridden in the custom backend.

  .. method:: publish_messages(messages)

    If your service that provides sending messages in batch, you can override the ``publish_messages`` method. Input argument is a list of messages. By default, ``publish_message`` method is used for sending and messages are send one by one.

  .. method:: bulk_check_sms_states()

    If your service provides checking SMS state you can override this method and implement code that check if SMS messages were delivered.

Commands
--------

``send_messages_batch``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned SMS messages can be sent in a batch with Django command ``send_messages_batch --type=sms``.

``bulk_check_sms_states``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because some services provide checking if SMS messages were delivered, pymess provides a command that calls backend method ``bulk_check_sms_state``. You can use this command inside cron and periodically call it. But SMS backend and service must provide it (must have implemented method ``bulk_check_sms_states``).
